# jQuery project UPDATED LATER
Upgraded To do list by ErnoK003

## Demo link:
Access my site at todolistbyerno.netlify.app(https://todolistbyerno.netlify.app/)

## How was the workload divided
I did everything myself. I used helpful tools like Google, W3Schools and Copilot to overcome any major obstacles.
Copilot was very helpful when commenting code. I used [my prior To do list](https://github.com/ErnoK003/DOM-scriptaus-projekti) as a template and also used the code, just changed things like DOM scripting to be done with jQuery. The earlier iteration is no longer available through the link, but the repository stays untouched.

## About The App
`To do list` is an app that lets you take notes, which you can later check as done or just delete them completely. It also works very well as a grocery list since it is also mobile-friendly. I made significant improvements compared to the earlier iteration. I added use of browser's local storage, which allows to save the list as long as the browser's memory is not deleted or reset. This means you can refresh the page or lock your smart phone without fear.

## Technologies
I used the following technologies `html`, `css`& `javascript`. I used `jQuery` as a javascript library to ease the making of this app.

## Setup
- download all the files and open index.html in your browser
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- OR open link provided above (easiest)

## Status
This project is finished, although some minor improvements may still be coming if I notice something worth of an update.
